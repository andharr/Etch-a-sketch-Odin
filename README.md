# Etch-a-sketch-Odin
My solution for the Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch assignment:

# Learnings:
-Creating a grid from user input using a for loop and CSS grid

-Objects created inside that for loop (here the boxes), should have attributes added inside the for loop. This was a difficult bug to solve. I originally added the attributes after object creation but when the event listeners couldn't find them I discovered they hadn't been added.

-It was fun reusing the random color generator I'd made in a previous group project.
